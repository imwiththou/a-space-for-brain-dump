Drawing from recent conversations and reflections, I realise just how much my passion for film shapes both my creative outlook and philosophical curiosity. Movies have a rare ability to capture the fullness of human experience, telling rich and resonant stories within a limited duration. This efficiency blends beautifully with artistry and thought, making cinema a place where narrative, craft and philosophy all come together in ways that feel both intense and meaningful.

Films are not simply forms of entertainment. They compress big questions about existence, morality and identity into immersive visual explorations. Reading books on filmmaking, such as “In the Blink of an Eye” by Walter Murch, continues to deepen my attention to the artistry behind filmmaking, helping me appreciate the intricate dance of vision, technique and emotion that defines the process. There is a beauty in the creation of motion pictures that feels alive, drawing on so many layers of expression and imagination.

Cinema serves as a living record of collective dreams, fears and aspirations—a visual study of what it means to be human. It also acts as a tool for building worlds, carving empathy and expressing thoughts and feelings that might otherwise remain unspoken. The role of music stands out too. As both a musician and a designer, I am often captivated by how a film's score can guide feeling, underlining and elevating each moment in a way that words alone cannot.

All of these insights come together to reinforce my feeling that cinema is a meeting ground for art, philosophy and personal discovery. It is a space that continues to inspire, challenge and clarify my sense of self and the world around me.
