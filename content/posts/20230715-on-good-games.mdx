When I grew up I was often told to avoid video games as they were addictive and could potential ruin my study and career (in the future). This is a typical Asian parents’ misunderstanding on video games. Good games not just provide an asylum for people to kill time with but also inspire them. They make us to think our existence as human being.

Games are the 9th form of art. A well designed and built game communicates stories profoundly with its players. Unlike music and films, games provide us more immersive experience with haptic feedbacks (most of modern controllers are capable of that now). 

The interactive nature of video games is what truly sets them apart from other forms of art. With films, we’re passive viewers, simply watching stories unfold in front of us. In games, we become the main character. It’s our choices that drive the narrative, our strategies that solve problems, and our moral compass that gets tested. This level of engagement offers a depth and complexity that’s unique to gaming—where the story isn’t just observed, but lived.

Take The Last of Us, for example. Players don’t just watch Joel and Ellie’s journey of survival; they feel the weight of every decision, the heartbreak, and the tension. The emotional stakes in games like this go far beyond entertainment—they force players to confront questions about humanity, sacrifice, and morality in a deeply personal way.

Games aren’t just about storytelling—they challenge us intellectually too. Many games require strategic thinking and adaptability. Titles like Elden Ring or Assassin’s Creed push players to think critically, adapt their tactics, and overcome complex challenges. These games train us to evaluate situations, take risks, and learn from failure—skills that go far beyond the gaming world.

Even games that aren’t as narrative-heavy, like Forza Horizon or Microsoft Flight Simulator, offer unique forms of engagement. Forza Horizon provides an exhilarating, immersive experience that captures the beauty and excitement of the open road. Meanwhile, Microsoft Flight Simulator offers stunning realism, allowing players to explore the world in a way that feels almost tangible, capturing both the technical mastery and the awe of flight.

Then there are games like GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, which provide players with sprawling open worlds that aren’t just backdrops for action, but fully realised, living environments. In these games, players have the freedom to explore, interact with the world, and make their own stories. The detail in Red Dead Redemption 2, for instance, is staggering—from the meticulous recreation of the Wild West to the subtle emotional nuances in its characters. It’s not just a game; it’s a living, breathing world where players can lose themselves for hours.

Games like Uncharted and Starfield offer a sense of adventure and discovery that mirrors the best of cinema, but with one crucial difference: you’re the one in control. Uncharted throws players into breathtaking, action-packed treasure hunts, while Starfield opens up the vast expanse of space for exploration. In both cases, the sense of agency—the feeling that you’re the one driving the story—makes the experience far more immersive than simply watching a film.

And then there are games like Journey, which offer a more minimalist yet equally profound experience. Journey isn’t just about gameplay mechanics; it’s about mood, emotion, and connection. The game’s stunning visual design and subtle storytelling evoke feelings of isolation and companionship in a way that’s hard to achieve in other art forms. It shows that games can communicate powerful emotions without needing complex narratives or flashy mechanics.

Social aspects of gaming are also significant. In multiplayer and online games, you’re not just playing alone—you’re interacting with people from all over the world. Whether it’s working together in a co-op mission or competing in a high-stakes race, these games foster community and collaboration. In many ways, online gaming has become a social platform, where friendships are formed and players learn to work together, often across different cultures and languages.

The artistic elements in video games have also evolved significantly. From the rich, cinematic landscapes of Red Dead Redemption 2 to the gorgeous, hand-crafted environments in Elden Ring, video games have become canvases for visual art. The craftsmanship that goes into designing these worlds is on par with and sometimes surpasses, what we see in films or fine art.

Then there’s the sheer creativity involved in game development. It’s a collaborative process that brings together writers, artists, composers, and designers to create something unique. The blend of these different creative fields results in an art form that’s far more than the sum of its parts. Games like Starfield or Assassin’s Creed are incredible feats of creativity and technical skill, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in both storytelling and design.

So, contrary to the belief that video games are simply time-wasters, they offer much more than just entertainment. They are art, problem-solving exercises, and social experiences all rolled into one. Games can engage us emotionally, intellectually and socially in ways that no other medium can. They offer a space where we can explore our own identities, confront ethical questions and experience a range of emotions—from joy to sorrow to awe.

For these reasons, video games deserve recognition as the 9th art form, right alongside literature, film and music. Instead of dismissing them as distractions or a waste of time, we should acknowledge the cultural, educational, and emotional value they provide to people worldwide.
