When I grew up I was often told to avoid video games as they were addictive and could potential ruin my study and career (in the future). This is a typical Asian parentsâ€™ misunderstanding on video games. Good games not just provide an asylum for people to kill time with but also inspire them. They make us to think our existence as human being.

Games are the 9th form of art. A well designed and built game communicates stories profoundly with its players. Unlike music and films, games provide us more immersive experience with haptic feedbacks (most of modern controllers are capable of that now).
