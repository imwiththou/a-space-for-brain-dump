We are all perpetually rushing, never feeling like time is sufficient.

We take pride in our speed, in hastening our progress – but in doing so, we risk missing out on the subtle details and the small things that bring us delightful moments in life.

In essence, all this rushing impoverishes us.

Speeding up doesn’t make us better people. We are constantly rushing, and what’s making it even more detrimental? Aimless rushing. 

Slowing down is vital in our creative field, as it allows us to notice details and uncover hidden aspects. This trend towards appreciating slowness is evident across art, design, and architecture.

It's about finding greater meaning in how we spend our time. It's about not settling for the first option and instead exploring deeper possibilities. Ultimately, this approach could take us further.
