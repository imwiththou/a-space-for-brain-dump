title: A walk in the winter forest

Every winter walk feels like stepping into a shared memory, one that stretches back through centuries and millennia. My friend and I wandered into the winter forest of Hallasan on the other day, with snow blanketing the ground quietly that felt ancient. No matter where we are on this planet, it's always the same kind of forest—one our ancestors once called home. Their breath mingled with the air of these trees, their footsteps pressed into the soil beneath this snow.

I wonder how our thoughts shift when we are surrounded by such stillness, especially in winter. The chill wind weaves through bare branches, whispering over a frozen stream where water once danced and crashed against black stones, scattering droplets like tiny shards of light. Those sounds—the rush of water, the rustle of leaves—they are gone now. In their place is an almost sacred silence, broken only by the occasional deep croak of ravens perched high above.  

There's something about this emptiness that feels full. A type of tranquility that doesn't demand anything from you except the presence. It's as if the forest itself invites you to pause, to listen—not to it, but to yourself.

We walked for hours, letting the path lead us deeper into the embrace of the trees. Each step pressed into the snow, a soft crunch beneath our boots, while the cold air bit at our cheeks with a sharpness that felt strangely invigorating. But none of it mattered—not the sting, not the chill. We were too caught up in the quiet wonder of it all, watching the world unfold around us like an unspoken poem.  

There was a weight to our steps, grounding us in the present, yet our laughter carried a lightness that seemed to rise and dissolve into the winter sky. In those moments, we weren't just visitors in the forest; we were part of it. The trees, the snow, the ravens calling from above—it all felt connected, woven together into one shared story. For a fleeting instant, we could feel it: we belonged.

The forest holds a quiet wisdom, one that speaks not in words but in cycles. Every fallen leaf, every decaying log, every patch of moss—they all play their part in a system that renews itself endlessly. Walking through the winter woods, I couldn't help but think about how effortless it all seems. Nothing is wasted; everything feeds into something else. It's a rhythm we've forgotten, one we've replaced with systems that take and take, leaving little behind.

The forest doesn't rush; it doesn't force change. It just keeps going, slowly but surely renewing itself with each passing season. Maybe we can do the same—not perfectly, not all at once, but little by little.

Perhaps that's how nature works.
