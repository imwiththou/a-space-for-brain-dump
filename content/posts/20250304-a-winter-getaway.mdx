I had just recently came back from a week-long trip to the mountains and streets of Jeju island in the winter. Witnessed the gorgeous snow-covered landscapes, the icy cold winds and the warm, cosy cafes. It was a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of the city. I had a great time exploring the island, trying out the local cuisine and meeting new people. 


"You are such a Mister Social Butterfly," Joe teased me. I laughed and replied, "Well, I can't help it. I love meeting new people and hearing their stories, and if possible, build a rapport and continue the conversation over a nice meal."
