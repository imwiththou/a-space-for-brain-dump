The new Leica M EV1 eliminates the very essence that made M cameras special for decades because: the rangefinder defines the M experience. 

The M EV1 feels like Leica is compromising its core identity to chase a broader market. The pricing only reinforces the sense that it's targeting affluent buyers rather than serious photographers who understand the rangefinder's unique value. 

The M EV1 might be technically capable, but it sacrifices the soul of the M system for convenience.
