In times like these, chasing moments of peace can feel pointless, maybe even foolish — a flicker of calm trying to stand up against the world's relentless storms. With headlines full of tension — scenes of conflict from Ukraine, sudden violence in the Middle East, and now the Trump back on the presidency throne again - everything feels like it's tipping toward uncertainty. Even with all of this, we still hold on to the idea of peace, maybe because we're hopelessly in love with what we believe matters most, even if it seems small, even if it seems fleeting.

In my own life lately, I've been feeling my own version of turbulence. Balancing everything—handling the renovations for my new flat, the constant moving in and moving out, pushing through driving lessons after work, and preparing for my first full marathon in early December - has been a lot. Then there's the bittersweetness of saying goodbye to my flatmates of six and a half years. We've lived like family, and leaving feels like losing a close brother to them. So many things seem to be stirring up at once, like life decided to pile everything together just to see how I'd handle it.

And yet, somehow, it's these little moments — the shared jokes with friends, a familiar walk home, the rare quiet of a room at night—that keep us steady, anchoring us in a world that feels anything but calm. Even if these moments don't change anything about the outside world, they ground us. They're reminders of what it means to feel fully human, to hold on to peace even when it seems out of reach.

Maybe that's why we cling to what we love about life, even if it seems a bit hopeless. It's not about making the world itself peaceful; it's about finding ways to feel whole and steady within it. These small, fragile bits of calm give us just enough reason to keep moving forward, despite everything.
