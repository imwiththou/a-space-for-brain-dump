You know what is wasting most of the time for most people? The state of being indecisive. When we are hesitating of making a decision or juggling between decisions, we waste most of the time. I'm saying this because I noticed there are so many people around are doing this and they are fine with it. As Seneca says, "Life is long if you know how to use it", I used have the same habit before, thinking about all the possible outcomes for various decisions but nowadays I tend to “just do it”. I think no matter what decision you made, as long as it's not detrimental, you can always gain something out of it, either experience or something valuable to your life and most of the time. It’s the same thing as those watching Netflix while spending half an hour deciding which show to watch or spending two hours deciding what’s for dinner. If there's food, make a routine and stick to it. I don't mind eating the same food every day or, occasionally, change the dinner recipe, as long as I have developed a routine to it. Speaking of that, there are just so many choices of food around me so it doesn't really make sense to waste time to make a decision about meals. There are other decisions to be made carefully, big decisions like buying a house or getting a car, they need more time to think about. Small decisions? Don’t waste time on them. Just go and expect some surprise along the way.
