With all the bad news and disasters spreading globally, it is easy to develop negative emotion towards then, assuming the world was a better place decades ago and it just got so much worsen in recent years. 

I do not completely agree with that. I still believe, optimistically, things will get better in the end. 

Sometimes we receive news around the world and they make us thinking the world is getting worse - itâ€™s mainly because news travels way faster these days hence, every little piece of bad news will get magnified through the lens of the Internet.

Meanwhile good news don't get much attention but bad ones travel miles because they are more juicy and attractive.

If we see these through with the tool of skepticism, we may seek the truth behind the mist.
