I think the major difference between a Mac and Windows computer is the delightful experience. When using Windows we are overwhelming with traditional corporate-style task management framework, roughly designed interfaces and interactions, when using macOS, because of the carefully crafted visual, haptic and audio feedbacks, seamless continuity and consistent product experience, we feel we are more like "playing" with the computer rather than just getting things done - things are being done in a creative, delightful way. Apple's attention to detail is undoubtfully insane.
