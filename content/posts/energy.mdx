title: Where attention goes, energy flows
description: The creation should still go on because there will be no listening if there's no voice. Every voice counts and every opinion matters.

Came across this poster on [Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so), a Pinterest alternative for designers, creators and artiests. 

I think the energy for creation is all about expressing our opinions to the rest of human species, regardless of art or design. We observe, think divergently for ideas and convergently for solutions. We try to talk to the rest of the world by sparking their mindsets. Truly, not all of them are willing to listen, very little of them are willing to adapt and change, we as creatives, should not be discouraged by them.

The creation should still go on because there will be no listening if there's no voice. Every voice counts and every opinion matters.

That's where all the energy summing up and contributing to a verse of ourselves.
