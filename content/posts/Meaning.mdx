Take a slice of lime and put it in the mouth. Feel the encounter of taste bud in explosive sourness. Lay down on a couch on Sunday afternoon. Hear the airplane roaming from distant sky. The hot, humid air mixed with oil exhaust from household downstairs in the apartment unit. What is real and what is worth to be noticed about? If life itself is merely just an illusion created by our will of wasting every second to pass them, does everything we tried in life - schooling, getting hired and sacked, travelling in the name of leisure, meeting someone that you may not meet again, seeing children growing up and yourself getting old if you have the “privilege”. Knowing that our body will be decomposed after death and there’s no such thing as afterlife. What is the meaning of living at the moment?
