Listening to music, jogging, swimming, blogging and journaling... these are things supposed to be done and enjoyed alone. It's not necessary to inject social media and interaction to every corner of our online activities. You may feel better when listening together, or jogging in a group, but that rule does not apply to everyone. I think we have been over emphasising on social media features in almost every apps, regardless whether it's truly necessary or not. An app, a service, a product - they are meant to help user to focus on the fundamental things, getting things done, bring delight and joy along the way. Extra good-to-have features should be kept at only a truly-matter and minimal level, and they should never be prioritised when basic and performance features are not polished well enough.
