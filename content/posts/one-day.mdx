One day, we are all gonna be aged and wiped away from this world. 

One day, we are all bidding our goodbyes to the loved ones. 

One day, we are all dying. 

How many days do we still have towards that one day? 

Counting days, counting weeks and years. 

Are we clocking the journey, or the inevitable journey is clocking us? 

*Carpe diem, carpe diem. Ad astra per aspera.*
