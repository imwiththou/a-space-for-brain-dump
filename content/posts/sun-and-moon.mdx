we can learn a lot\
from the love story of\
the sun and the moon\
trading places day and night\
allowing the other to rest\
only seeing each other\
for brief moments each day

but the moon watches\
the sun light up the sky\
and the sun watches\
the moon control the tides\
and they are happy\
because the other is\
doing what they love
