The web loves big numbers. Marketers use those numbers to impress and validate. When it comes to communities, to human beings, nonetheless, bigger is not always better. In fact, the opposite is often true. It's in small groups that we have chances to discuss things that are important to us. It's in small groups that we have time and space to debate and grow. **Deeper conversations can only occur in the right context and big communities don't allow for that because big communities move too fast. Individuals become less and less important the bigger a community grows.**

We should treasure small online communities because small communities are the best communities. Blogs with a handful of dedicated readers, forums with fewer than fifty users, group chats with a dozen participants. Those are success stories. Not becoming huge can and should be seen as a good thing.

We don't need a million followers and maybe we don't need a thousand true fans. However we probably could use ten good internet friends to make our digital life better. **It's never about quantity but quality.**
