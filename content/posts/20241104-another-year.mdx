> I will chase away the dark.

It might just be a pure coincident that when I was more or there ready to move into my new flat, Slack reminds me today that it's my first anniversary of being at the new job with the new team - well they are not that new physically, but somehow I still find them distant, comparing to my previous job.

The journey was defifinte a challenge to me for the past year. The whole renovation, after planning, design, execution and finishing up since 18 months ago, things came up and down, there were both stagination and climax, glad that it's more or less down without much deviation from the original plan. It's surprising to see myself planned so long ahead and still having it aligned with the schedule.

Having that being said, I had tasted tremendous amont of struggle and bittersweet moments from the new house journey. There were sacrifice to make, decisions to take, sometimes planning itself won't come perfectly but I just need to make a quick call and push things moving forward, and yes my wallet bleeds, multiple times. 

The reward? The journey is the reward, my dear. 

Giving myself a pat on the shoulder, it's never been easy.
