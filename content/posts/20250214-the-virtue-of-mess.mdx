I’ve recently read [“A Perfect Mess” by E. Abrahamson and D. H. Freedman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132176.A_Perfect_Mess), a work that challenges our societal obsession with tidiness and organisation and have some thoughts to jot down here, especially to this question: 

> Have we lost sight of the inherent value of chaos in our relentless pursuit of order and efficiency?

The authors posit that a moderate level of messiness can lead to more efficient resource utilisation, enhanced problem-solving and increased systemic resilience. Their argument, while provocative, invites us to reconsider our deeply ingrained assumptions about the superiority of order.

Yet, as with any paradigm-shifting idea, we must approach it with critical thought. The claim that messy systems are more resilient seems to contradict the observable inefficiencies in bureaucratic structures. Similarly, the success of highly organised systems like the Japanese 5S methodology appears to challenge the notion that we overvalue neatness.

These apparent contradictions, however, do not necessarily negate the book’s central thesis. Instead, they highlight the complexity of the relationship between order and chaos. Perhaps the key lies in distinguishing between different types of “mess” - the flexibility of creative disorder versus the rigidity of bureaucratic complexity.

The value of “A Perfect Mess” lies not in providing definitive answers, but in prompting us to question our assumptions. It challenges us to find a balance between order and chaos that aligns with our individual needs and circumstances.
In this light, the book echoes Nietzsche’s concept of the Apollonian and Dionysian forces in art and life. Apollo, the god of reason and order and Dionysus, the god of chaos and emotion, are not opposing forces to be reconciled but complementary aspects of existence. Perhaps true harmony emerges not from rigid structure but from the dynamic interplay between order and disorder.

As we navigate an increasingly complex world, the insights offered by “A Perfect Mess” provide a valuable perspective. They remind us that in life, as in nature, true creativity and resilience often emerge from the edge of chaos. In embracing a degree of messiness, we might find new pathways to innovation and fulfilment.

In contemplating the merits of mess, we are reminded of Schopenhauer’s assertion that life “*swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom*”. Perhaps in the messiness of life, we find the vitality that rescues us from the tedium of perfect order. The challenge, then, is not to eliminate mess entirely but to cultivate a form of organised chaos–a delicate balance where creativity flourishes and efficiency persists.
