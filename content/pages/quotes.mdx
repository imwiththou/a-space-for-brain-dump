> Simplicity, of course, is not the absence of complexity. Just removing clutter would result in uncomplicated but meaningless products.

> THERE’S LOTS OF WAYS TO BE, as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. You never meet the people, you never shake their hands, you never hear their story or tell them yours, but somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. We need to be true to who we are, and remember what’s really important to us. That’s what’s going to keep Apple, Apple - is if we keep us, us.

> I love my friends. I love my children. I love talking to people at a party or a dinner or an event and learning from them. Love is minimalism. Desire, possession, and control are not minimalism. Minimalism of things? No. Minimalism of fear, anxiety, stress, mourning. I don’t like any intrigue. I don’t like to gossip about people. When I do that, I feel like I am carrying those people in my backpack. So the more I gossip, the heavier my baggage is. I don’t like feeling bad if someone doesn’t like me. That’s also baggage. I try to leave that behind. And we’re all different. You never really know why someone is doing the things they are doing.

> Understand that the problem existed because you wasn’t capable of handling it, and focus one step at a time on what you can control (about) your emotions and actions. Let go of the past, the most important is to focus on the present, because that’s how the future is created. Choose your people carefully, give everything to people you will die for, because they will do the same for you.

> **A. Chee**

> When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and you're job is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: **Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.**

> Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen. (Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.)

> **L. Wittgenstein**
