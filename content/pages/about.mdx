This website is not intended to be a body of work. It is meant to be, ostensibly, a living body; connected, growing, broken at times. It will add weight with age, perhaps learn from its mistakes and most certainly change its mind. Fundamentally, the site is an experiment. Its content will be a mixture of work and play, old and new, commissioned and personal. 


If nothing else, the hope is that this site accurately represents its author: intentional, haphazard, intermittent and occasionally inspiring.
