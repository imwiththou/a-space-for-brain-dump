This website is not intended to be a body of work. It is meant to be, ostensibly, a living body; connected, growing, broken at times. It will add weight with age, perhaps learn from its mistakes and most certainly change its mind. Fundamentally, the site is an experiment. Its content will be a mixture of work and play, old and new, commissioned and personal. 


If nothing else, the hope is that this site accurately represents its author: intentional, haphazard, intermittent and occasionally inspiring.

This is Steve.

I never enjoy doing something that’s consideres as "normal". Almost everything I did were driven by inspiration and passion, rather than instructions or status quo. “You are weird” is so far the best compliment ever received from friends. 

When I was 10 years old, school teachers asked me what I’d like to do when growing up, I told them I wanted to be an astronomer. 

Yes I grabbed the word from Oxford dictionary, because I didn’t how to spell that word yet. 

> Oh you mean you want to be an astronaut? 

> No, I don’t want to be an astronaut. I want to be an astronomer, studying universe and stars.

Never a fan of pop music. I am a classically trained musician - or music amateur - cos I don’t make a living of music, but music is an inseparable part of my life. 

In *[August Rush](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426931)*, little Freddie Highmore and Robin Williams were lying down on the mattress in the attic of a abandoned theatre, they looked out of the broken ceiling, to the starry night sky, Robin Williams said: 

> You know what’s out there? A series of higher tones. It’s arranged by nature. It’s governed by the laws of physics of the whole universe. It’s an overtone, it’s an energy, it’s a wavelength. And if you’re not riding it, good Lordy, you’ll never hear it. 

I think that’s the relationship between music and me. I can play music for hours and forgetting about eating or sleeping. I do not need more words when I am playing. I am talking through music. 

Of course not being a fan of pop music doesn’t mean I do no listen to them. Just as a sportsman should be genuinely interested in all kinds of sports, a musician should listen to all genres of music so he will learn to appreciate them well. There are several great pop musicians in the history who redefined how pop songs can be well composed and crafted. Simon and Garfunkel, Coldplay, Cody Fry, Owl City, Jason Mraz, you name them.
